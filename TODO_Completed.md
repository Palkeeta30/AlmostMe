## Implementation Summary:

### ‚úÖ **Unity-Style Implementation Complete:**

1. **Blade Mechanics** (Converted from Unity's Blade.cs)

   - Mouse/touch input handling like Unity's Update() method
   - Direction calculation for cutting force
   - Velocity-based slicing detection
   - Trail rendering with SVG paths

2. **Fruit Slicing Logic** (Converted from Unity's Fruit.cs)

   - Whole vs sliced fruit states
   - Physics-based slicing with force application
   - Collision detection with blade (distance-based)
   - Score management system

3. **Enhanced Particle System**

   - Physics-based particle animation with gravity
   - Direction-based particle spread like Unity
   - Item-specific particle colors and behaviors
   - Automatic cleanup when particles expire

4. **Advanced Visual Effects**

   - Screen shake system like Unity
   - Slice trail with glow effects
   - Item-specific cutting animations
   - Combo-based visual feedback

5. **Unity-Style Physics**
   - Gravity simulation for particles
   - Velocity and acceleration calculations
   - Force application on sliced objects
   - Realistic collision detection

### üìÅ **Files Created:**

- `src/components/games/ReactionRushParticles.jsx` - Particle system component
- `src/components/games/ReactionRushEnhanced.jsx` - Enhanced game component
- `src/components/games/ReactionRushEnhanced.css` - Advanced animations
- `src/components/games/ReactionRushUnity.jsx` - Unity-style implementation
- `src/components/games/ReactionRushUnity.css` - Unity-style CSS

### üéÆ **Key Unity Concepts Converted:**

- **Blade.cs**: Mouse input, direction calculation, trail rendering
- **Fruit.cs**: Slicing logic, particle effects, physics simulation
- **GameManager**: Score management and game state
- **Physics**: Rigidbody simulation, force application, collision detection

The game now features authentic Fruit Ninja-style mechanics with Unity-quality visual effects, physics simulation, and responsive gameplay!
