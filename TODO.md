# CSRF Fix for Fitness Page

## Changes Made

✅ **Updated CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS** in `almostme/settings.py`:

- Added additional localhost ports (3001, 8080, 4200)
- Added wildcard origins for all localhost ports (`http://localhost:*`, `http://127.0.0.1:*`)
- This ensures all common development server ports are trusted

✅ **Updated CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS** to match CSRF settings:

- Added the same additional ports for consistency
- Ensures cross-origin requests work properly

✅ **Enhanced CSRF settings for development**:

- Set `CSRF_USE_SESSIONS = False` for better cookie handling
- Set `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False` to allow JavaScript to read CSRF tokens
- Set `CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'` for more permissive development environment

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Django server** to apply the new settings
2. **Test the fitness page** to ensure CSRF errors are resolved
3. **Verify API calls** from React frontend work properly
4. **Check browser console** for any remaining issues

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fitness page loads without CSRF errors
- [ ] User profile creation/update works
- [ ] Workout logging functionality works
- [ ] Workout history retrieval works
- [ ] Workout plan retrieval works
- [ ] No console errors related to CSRF

## Troubleshooting

If CSRF errors persist:

1. Check which port the React development server is running on
2. Verify the exact origin in the browser's network tab
3. Ensure Django server is restarted after settings changes
4. Check if there are any proxy configurations in package.json
