# TODO: Fix Railway Deployment Issues

## Completed
- [x] Add psycopg2-binary and dj-database-url to requirements.txt
- [x] Update settings.py to use DATABASE_URL environment variable for database configuration

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Commit and push the changes to GitHub
- [ ] Redeploy the loving-wholeness instance on Railway to apply database configuration fixes
- [ ] Add EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD environment variable to the optimistic-ambition instance
- [ ] Redeploy the optimistic-ambition instance on Railway
- [ ] Test both deployments to ensure they work without 500 errors

## Notes
- The 500 error on loving-wholeness was likely due to using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL on Railway.
- Both instances need EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD for email functionality.
- Keep both instances: loving-wholeness as production, optimistic-ambition as staging.
