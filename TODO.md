# TODO: Fix Signup Issue - Production Serving Setup

## Steps to Complete:
1. **Build React App**: Run `npm run build` to generate the production build in the `build/` directory.
2. **Copy Build Contents to Staticfiles**: Copy all contents from `build/` to `staticfiles/` so Django can serve the React SPA.
3. **Run Collectstatic**: Execute `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` to ensure all static files are collected properly.
4. **Test Locally**: Start Django server with `python manage.py runserver` and verify signup at http://localhost:8000/signup using browser.
5. **Deploy to Railway**: Commit changes (if any) and push to GitHub; Railway will auto-deploy. Verify on production URL.

Progress:
- [x] Step 1: Build React
- [x] Step 2: Copy Build to Staticfiles
- [x] Step 3: Collectstatic
- [x] Step 4: Local Test
- [x] Step 5: Deploy (Run `git add . && git commit -m "Fix signup by serving React via Django staticfiles" && git push` for Railway auto-deploy)

# Task: Fix Signup Issue and Deployment Blank Page

## Current Work
- Resolved local "Failed to fetch" by serving React via Django staticfiles (build, copy to staticfiles/build, collectstatic).
- Partial browser testing: Page loads, fields interactive.
- Deployment issue: Blank page on Railway due to missing build/index.html in staticfiles (collectstatic skips non-static dirs).
- Plan: Update railway.toml to copy build/* to staticfiles during build, commit/push for auto-deploy.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Django static serving for SPA: urls.py fallback to build/index.html.
- Railway CI/CD: TOML defines build commands (npm build + collectstatic); add cp for HTML.
- Git deployment: Commit/push triggers rebuild.

## Relevant Files and Code
- railway.toml: Add "cp -r build/* staticfiles/" after npm run build.
- TODO.md: Track steps.

## Problem Solving
- Local works; prod fails on missing SPA entry point.
- Solution: Explicit copy in build script.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
- [x] Edit railway.toml to include copy command.
- [x] Update TODO.md with progress.
- [x] Run git add/commit/push to deploy.
- [ ] Verify production signup at https://almostme-production.up.railway.app/signup (load page, submit form, check user creation/login).
- [ ] Test error cases (duplicates).
- [ ] If success, complete task.
