# Fix Railway Deployment Crash

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Rewrite requirements.txt in clean UTF-8 encoding to ensure pip can install dependencies including gunicorn.
- [x] Update Procfile to include `:application` in gunicorn command for proper Django WSGI module loading.
- [x] Add `pip install -r requirements.txt` to railway.toml build commands to explicitly install Python dependencies in mixed project setup.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Commit and push changes to GitHub repository.
- [ ] Redeploy the application on Railway (via Railway dashboard or automatic trigger on push).
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs to confirm successful deployment and gunicorn startup.
- [ ] Test the application endpoints to ensure functionality.
